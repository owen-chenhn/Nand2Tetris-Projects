The program implements a snake game. Use four arrow keys to control the snake. 
Eating a piece of food on the screen can increment the length of snake by 1 pixel. 
The game terminates when the head of the snake hits its body. 

The user input are 5 keys: space, left arrow, up arrow, right arrow and down arrow. 
Press space to freeze the snake on the screen. Then press any arrow key to unfreeze it.  
All other keys have no effect. 

The snake is initialized as frozen (not moving) when the game starts. Press any arrow key to let it move.
         
Note:  Pressing a reverse direction of snake's current direction also has no effect. 
          The default direction at the start is set to the right. So pressing the left arrow when the game starts 
          will not change its direction.
